Additionally, my internship focused on machine learning, where I fine-tuned pre-trained models and developed custom algorithms, aligns well with your preference for candidates experienced in ML and chatbot development.\n\nI am particularly drawn to SOCOTEC\u2019s holistic approach to sustainability and energy efficiency, as these values resonate with my passion for innovative technology solutions.
